# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

Welcome to the *Requirement Analysis* repository. This project is dedicated to understanding the process of requirement analysis in software development.

Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs are identified, documented, and validated to ensure the successful delivery of a project.

This repository serves as a guide and resource for learning and implementing effective requirement analysis techniques.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that bridges the gap between the stakeholders' vision and the technical implementation of a system.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis:
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting stakeholder needs through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Creating detailed specifications, user stories, and use cases.
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring that the requirements align with stakeholders' needs and are feasible within the project constraints.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis:
1. **Clarity**: Defines a clear scope for the project, reducing ambiguity.
2. **Feasibility**: Ensures that requirements are realistic and achievable within the given resources and timeframe.
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Aligns all stakeholders with a unified understanding of the project goals.
4. **Risk Reduction**: Minimizes the risk of project failure due to missed or misunderstood requirements.

Requirement Analysis lays the foundation for the design, development, and testing phases, ensuring the final product meets user expectations and delivers value.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a cornerstone of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process is guided by a clear understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations. Here are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Defines the Scope of the Project**  
   Requirement Analysis helps define what the software will and will not do. By establishing a clear scope, it minimizes misunderstandings and prevents scope creep, ensuring the project stays on track.

2. **Improves Communication and Collaboration**  
   The process facilitates better communication between stakeholders, developers, and project managers. It ensures everyone involved has a shared understanding of the goals, reducing conflicts and enhancing collaboration.

3. **Reduces Risks and Costs**  
   Identifying and addressing potential issues during the requirement phase can save significant time and resources. It reduces the risk of project failure by ensuring requirements are feasible, testable, and aligned with business objectives.

4. **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction**  
   By understanding and documenting user needs thoroughly, Requirement Analysis ensures the final product meets or exceeds user expectations, resulting in higher satisfaction and better usability.

Requirement Analysis is essential for delivering a successful software project that aligns with business goals and provides value to stakeholders.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are categorized into two main types: Functional Requirements and Non-functional Requirements. Both are essential to defining the complete behavior of a system but however they different in this way.

### 1. Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements describe what the system should do. They define the system's functionality and behavior in response to specific inputs or conditions.

#### Examples for Booking Management Project:
- Users should be able to **search for available hotels** based on location, check-in, and check-out dates.
- The system should allow users to **book a hotel room** and receive a confirmation email.
- Users should be able to **view the photo gallery** of each hotel, including images of rooms and amenities.
- The platform should display detailed information about accommodations, such as the **number of bedrooms** and **number of showers** for each option.
- Administrators should be able to **add, update, or remove hotel listings** from the platform.
- The system should provide a **payment gateway integration** for processing online transactions.

### 2. Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional Requirements define how the system should perform. They focus on aspects like performance, usability, reliability, and scalability.

#### Examples for Booking Management Project:
- The system should support **1,000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.
- Response time for search queries should not exceed **2 seconds**.
- The platform must

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are a set of conditions that a system or feature must satisfy in order to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They serve as a detailed checklist to ensure that a feature meets both the functional and non-functional expectations defined in the requirements. Acceptance Criteria provide clarity on what constitutes a successful implementation and help guide the development, testing, and validation process.

#### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis
- **Clarity:** Acceptance criteria provide clear and specific conditions that must be met, reducing ambiguity in requirements.
- **Validation:** They ensure that features are implemented correctly and function as intended, preventing scope creep or misalignment with stakeholder expectations.
- **Testing:** Acceptance criteria serve as a basis for writing test cases, helping QA teams verify that features are working as expected.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** They enable stakeholders to review the final implementation and confirm whether it meets their needs before approval or release.

#### Example of Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System

The **Checkout** feature allows users to complete their bookings by entering payment details and finalizing their reservation. Below are the acceptance criteria for the Checkout feature:

1. **User Login Requirement:**
   - The user must be logged in to proceed to checkout.
   - If the user is not logged in, they should be prompted to sign in or register.

2. **Room Selection:**
   - The user must have selected at least one room before proceeding to checkout.
   - The checkout page should display the room details, including the type of room, price, and booking dates.

3. **Payment Details:**
   - The user must enter valid payment information (credit card, debit card, or digital wallet).
   - The payment system must validate the payment method and display an error message if the payment fails.

4. **Order Summary:**
   - The checkout page must display a detailed order summary that includes:
     - Selected hotel name, room type, number of bedrooms, and number of showers.
     - Total cost breakdown (room cost, taxes, service fees).
     - Any available discounts or promotions applied.
   
5. **Confirmation Page:**
   - After a successful payment, the user must be redirected to a confirmation page.
   - The confirmation page should display a booking reference number, hotel name, check-in/check-out dates, and payment confirmation.
   - An email confirmation should be sent to the user with booking details.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - If the payment fails or is declined, the user should see an error message explaining the issue and be prompted to retry with a different payment method.
   - If a required field (such as payment info) is missing, the system should notify the user and prevent them from proceeding until the missing information is provided.
